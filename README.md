# Flood Prediction and Supply Chain Optimization

This project provides an **AI-powered mobile solution** for **flood prediction** and **supply chain optimization** during natural disasters like floods. The app leverages **edge AI** to provide **real-time flood forecasts**, **route optimization** for deliveries, and **automated resource management** to ensure timely procurement of perishables and backup power, minimizing dependency on cloud infrastructure.

## Features

- **Real-time Flood Prediction**: AI-based flood forecasting for accurate predictions.
- **Route Optimization**: Dynamic route adjustments based on flood data to ensure timely delivery and minimize disruptions.
- **Automated Resource Management**: Predicts and places orders for perishables and backup power based on flood forecasts.
- **Localized Decision-Making**: Client-side AI processing for faster, cloud-independent decisions during floods.
- **Supply Chain Continuity**: Helps businesses ensure uninterrupted operations during natural disasters.

## Technologies Used

- **Intel® AI PC (CPU, NPU, GPU)** for local processing.
- **Intel® OpenVINO™ Toolkit** for optimized AI models.
- **Android Native Development (Java)** for app development.
- **Route Optimization Algorithms** for real-time supply chain adjustments.

## Usage

- **Input**: The app takes the **date of prediction** and the **type of manufacturing unit** as inputs.
- **Output**: It provides **real-time flood predictions**, **optimized delivery routes**, and recommendations for **resource procurement** (e.g., perishables and backup power).
  
## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with Real-Time Flood Data**: Link with live flood data sources for more accurate predictions.
- **User Notifications**: Real-time alerts for businesses when disaster events are predicted to impact their operations.
